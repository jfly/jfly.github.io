title: About Me
---

Hey there! My name is Jeremy Fleischman. I love the outdoors,
[coding](https://github.com/jfly/),
[reading](http://www.shelfari.com/jfly/shelf), and
[speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2005FLEI01).
I particularly love to combine my
[interests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seK7Kw4GR4o)
[in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-TvSWPrBi4)
[weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ljZZo-8YC4)
[ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8JOC1NkVP8), and
[attempt to do stupid things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AorkxGK2Qow).

I graduated from San Clemente High School in 2006, and UC Berkeley in 2010.

[Dan Dzoan](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2006DZOA03)
passed the presidency of the
[Rubik's Cube club at Berkeley](http://cubing.berkeley.edu/) to me in January 2008. While president,
I organized 7 Rubik's cube competitions to varying degrees of success. I also
ran the speedcubing DeCal, and was an instructor for the beginner's Rubik's
Cube DeCal.

In March 2010, I handed the presidency to the amazing
[Vincent Sheu](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2006SHEU01). Under
Vincent (and as of this writing, the next 4 presidents!), the club has only
continued to mature and grow. There is nothing I am more proud to have played a
role in.

Not long after graduating from Berkeley, I attended
[US Nationals 2010](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=USNationals2010)
as a staff member and became US National Champion of one handed.

At [Berkeley Spring 2013](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=BerkeleySpring2013), I set the North American Record for one handed
single with an 11.28 second solve.

### Projects I'm particularly proud of

(in rougly chronological order)

<a name="ti">
* 2003:
</a>
I got a TI-83+ for high school, and became fascinated with calculator games. I
couldn't understand why the games I wrote in TI-BASIC ran so much slower than the amazing
[Phoenix](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/148/14876.html). This
led me to [United TI](unitedti.org) and [ticalc](ticalc.org), where I
learned about assembly programming. I struggled through a tutorial on Z80
assembly, and eventually completed
[The Poopsmith](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/317/31775.html).
* 2007-2010:
Developed [CCT](http://cct.cubing.net/) along with
[Ryan Zheng](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2006ZHEN02),
the
[first](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/speedsolvingrubikscube/conversations/messages/34984)
piece of software to interface with a stackmat timer over an audio cable.
* 2008:
Wrote a 2x2x2 solver for [Gamescrafters](http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/alumni.php).
Built a simulator blatantly modeled after Ryan Heise's
seminal [heise sim](http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed.html). This eventually
grew into a suite of simulators known as
[jflysim](http://jfly.cubing.net/jflysim/qqTimer.html).
* February 6-7, 2010:
Participated in the [UC Berkeley
Hackathon](http://archive.dailycal.org/article.php?id=108145) with [Peter
Battaglino](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2009BATT02),
[Kevin
Jorgensen](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2006JORG01),
and [Darren
Kwong](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2005KWON01).
Developed an [ascii Rubik's cube
simulator](https://github.com/jfly/Hackathon2010) in python with ncurses. We
each won $20 to Cheeseboard =). See [Kevin's writeup of the
event](http://spacestation77.wordpress.com/2010/02/07/berkeley-hackathon-2010/)
and [Peter's rewrite from scratch](https://github.com/peterbat/rubikon).
* 2010:
After finding myself occasionally using [qqtimer](http://www.qqtimer.net/),
I finally admitted to myself that webapps are generally easier to use than
desktop apps. I abandonded CCT, and starting writing a webtimer (which eventually became [TNT](http://www.jflei.com/tnt/)). Too
lazy to port CCT's scrambling and drawing code to javascript, I decided to
generate scrambles server side, and
[TNoodle was born](https://github.com/cubing/tnoodle/commit/ccdada3b9e29b545a6c2274c2890fc229723fda8). 
* January 1, 2013:
TNoodle adopted as the World Cube Association's
[official scrambler](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/posts/wca-documents-updated-january-1-2013).

I've also contributed to the [WCA workbook
assistant](https://github.com/cubing/wca-workbook-assistant) and
[twisty.js](https://github.com/cubing/twisty.js).
