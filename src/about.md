title: About Me
---

Hey there! My name is Jeremy Fleischman. I love the outdoors,
[coding](https://github.com/jfly/),
[reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51546534-jeremy-fleischman), and
[speedcubing](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2005FLEI01).
I particularly love to combine my
[interests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seK7Kw4GR4o)
[in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-TvSWPrBi4)
[weird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ljZZo-8YC4)
[ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8JOC1NkVP8), and
[attempt to do stupid things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AorkxGK2Qow).

### Past

I graduated from San Clemente High School in 2006, and UC Berkeley in 2010.

[Dan Dzoan](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2006DZOA03)
passed the presidency of the
[Rubik's Cube club at Berkeley](https://cube.berkeley.edu/) to me in January 2008. While president,
I organized 7 Rubik's cube competitions to varying degrees of success. I also
ran the speedcubing DeCal, and was an instructor for the beginner's Rubik's
Cube DeCal.

In March 2010, I handed the presidency to the amazing
[Vincent Sheu](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2006SHEU01). Under
Vincent (and as of this writing, the next 4 presidents!), the club has only
continued to mature and grow. There is nothing I am more proud to have played a
role in.

Not long after graduating from Berkeley, I attended
[US Nationals 2010](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/USNationals2010)
as a staff member and became US National Champion of one-handed.

At [Berkeley Spring 2013](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/BerkeleySpring2013), I set the North American Record for one-handed
single with an 11.28 second solve.

I worked at [Arista Networks](https://www.arista.com) from August 2010 to
March 2015, when I left to found and lead the WCA Software Team.

I worked at [Saddle Point Systems](https://www.saddlepointsystems.com/resources/about/) from December 2015 to May 2016.

I led the [World Cube Association Software Team](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/contact) from March 2015 to October 2019.

I worked as a principal engineer/senior staff engineer at [Honor](https://www.honorcare.com/) from January 2018 to August 2024.

### Projects I'm particularly proud of

(in roughly chronological order)

* 2003:
  <a name="ti"></a>
  I got a TI-83+ for high school, and became fascinated with calculator games. I
  couldn't understand why the games I wrote in TI-BASIC ran so much slower than the amazing
  [Phoenix](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/148/14876.html). This
  led me to [United TI](https://www.cemetech.net/projects/uti/index.php?sid=2b849d68f687595c84f032f87d382c52)
  and [ticalc](https://ticalc.org), where I
  learned about assembly programming. I struggled through a tutorial on Z80
  assembly, and eventually completed
  [The Poopsmith](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/317/31775.html).
* 2007-2010:
  Developed [CCT](https://cct.cubing.net/) along with
  [Ryan Zheng](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2006ZHEN02),
  the
  [first](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/speedsolvingrubikscube/conversations/messages/34984)
  piece of software to interface with a stackmat timer over an audio cable.
* 2008:
  Wrote a 2x2x2 solver for [Gamescrafters](http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/alumni.php).
  Built a simulator blatantly modeled after Ryan Heise's
  seminal [heise sim](https://www.ryanheise.com/cube/speed.html). This eventually
  grew into a suite of simulators known as
  [jflysim](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~jfly/projects/qqTimer/qqTimer.htm).
* February 6-7, 2010:
  Participated in the [UC Berkeley
  Hackathon](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:og9pPp2Jz7oJ:https://archive.dailycal.org/article.php%3Fid%3D108145+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) with [Peter
  Battaglino](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009BATT02),
  [Kevin
  Jorgensen](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2006JORG01),
  and [Darren
  Kwong](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2005KWON01).
  Developed an [ascii Rubik's cube
  simulator](https://github.com/jfly/Hackathon2010) in python with ncurses. We
  each won $20 to Cheeseboard =). See [Kevin's write-up of the
  event](https://spacestation77.wordpress.com/2010/02/07/berkeley-hackathon-2010/)
  and [Peter's rewrite from scratch](https://github.com/peterbat/rubikon).
* 2010:
  <a name="tnoodle"></a>
  After finding myself occasionally using [qqtimer](https://www.qqtimer.net/),
  I finally admitted to myself that webapps are generally easier to use than
  desktop apps. I abandoned CCT, and starting writing a webtimer (which eventually became [TNT](https://www.jflei.com/tnt/). Too
  lazy to port CCT's scrambling and drawing code to JavaScript, I decided to
  generate scrambles server side, and
  [TNoodle was born](https://github.com/cubing/tnoodle/commit/ccdada3b9e29b545a6c2274c2890fc229723fda8).
* January 1, 2013:
  TNoodle adopted as the World Cube Association's
  [official scrambler](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/posts/wca-documents-updated-january-1-2013).

I've also contributed to the [WCA Workbook Assistant](https://github.com/cubing/wca-workbook-assistant) and
[twisty.js](https://github.com/cubing/twisty.js).
