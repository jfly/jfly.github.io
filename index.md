I'm a programmer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I like making computers do things. I believe [Nix](https://nixos.org) is the
one of the best tools to make computers do things. As a result, I spend a lot
of my time contributing to the Nix ecosystem.

I'm open to freelance work. Feel free to [contact me](/contact/) if you have a
project you would like help with.

I also have [other hobbies](/about), but programming is the one that pays the
bills. I occasionally [blog](/blog) about my projects.
