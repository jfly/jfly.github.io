title: What does a TI-83+ have in common with a stackmat?
date: 2014-08-20

It started with a coincidence: the
[stackmat](http://www.speedstacks.com/store/retail/speed-stacks-stackmat-pro-timer/)
and the
[TI-83+](http://education.ti.com/en/us/products/calculators/graphing-calculators/ti-83-plus/features/features-summary)
have the same 2.5mm communication port.

If you haven't heard of a stackmat, it's the timer used in Rubik's Cube
competitions. I first played with one at [Caltech Spring
2005](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=CaltechSpring2005).
After the competition, I convinced my mom to buy me one.

Before I started speedcubing, I was
[very into calculator programming](/about#ti). Outside of the
time I spent using my beloved TI-83+ to do actual math, I spent hundreds of
hours and untold AAA batteries programming on that overpriced device with its
cramped keyboard. When I learned that some people had managed to
[wire a PS/2 keyboard to their calculators](http://www.radicalsoft.org/hardware/keyboard/),
it was something I *had* to try out. I bought all the components needed for the
project, but a general lack of EE knowledge
meant that I never actually got the project working, and my mom eventually made
me move the mess into our garage.

The upshot of all this is that when my stackmat arrived, I already
had the adapter and cables to plug my stackmat into my computer via the
microphone jack.

I wanted to practice with my new stackmat, but I also wanted to keep track of
my times without manually entering them into my computer. I scoured
the internet for a program to interpret the sound of my stackmat.
To my great surprise, I couldn't find any! To this day, I believe I was the first
person to try this.

I graduated from high school in 2006, and spent some time that summer deciphering
the stackmat protocol. I'll never forget the thrill of zooming into a recording
and seeing a repeated waveform.

After a long time staring at screenshots from Audacity, I was able to decode
stackmat signals by hand (many years later, I learned that I had reverse engineered
the [RS-232](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232) standard).
Friends and other projects kept me from writing a software signal
interpreter that summer. It wasn't until I had settled into my freshman year of
college that I finally sat down and coded a truly awful, barely working
stackmat interpreter in Java.

I kept this project secret, confiding only in [Darren
Kwong](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2005KWON01).
I decided to demonstrate my work at Berkeley's first Rubik's Cube competition,
[Berkeley Fall 2006](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/c.php?i=Berkeley2006).
Of course, that didn't happen. I had never staffed a
competition before, but there's rarely a moment of free time. Berkeley's first
competition was no exception. Fortunately, we
all met up at
[Dan Dzoan](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2006DZOA03)'s
apartment afterwards, and I was able to show off my hard work.
I like to think that people were impressed and excited about my work, but I honestly only remember the reactions of two people:
[Chris Hunt](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2005HUNT01),
and [Ryan Zheng](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2006ZHEN02).

Chris Hunt was the creator of the legendary JNetCube. At the time,
almost every cuber I knew used JNetCube. He proposed adding my stackmat support to
it, and I remember being honored by the opportunity to contribute to a real
piece of software that other people use.

I'm sure I would have become a contributor to JNetCube if not for Ryan Zheng.
Ryan wanted to see my awful code, and then felt compelled to improve it.
He eventually pulled out his own laptop, and we descended into a full night of hacking.
That night lengthened into a full weekend. At one
point, Ryan suggested the unthinkable: rather than just giving this feature to
JNetCube, we could build our own superior timer! That moment was the birth of
[C.A.L. Cube Timer (CCT)](http://cct.cubing.net/).
CCT received a lot of attention from the cubing community, and we worked for
years to keep up with the requests. Many features that were first introduced in
CCT live on in the the myriad cube timers we have today. Perhaps my proudest
moment was seeing [this video](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMTMzNzY4MTgw.html)
of a Chinese cuber using a translated version of CCT.

CCT eventually grew into [TNoodle](/about#tnoodle), the official WCA scrambling
program. I am very proud of TNoodle, and it gives me great joy to know that
it is used weekly as part of running official Rubik's Cube competitions.
